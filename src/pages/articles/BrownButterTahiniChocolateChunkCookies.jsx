    <p>These cookies take the classic chocolate chip cookie to a whole new level with the nutty depth of brown butter and the subtle sesame flavor of tahini. The combination creates a sophisticated, complex flavor profile that will make these your new favorite indulgence.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3/4 cup tahini, well-stirred</li>
      <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>8 ounces high-quality dark chocolate, chopped into chunks (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
      <li>Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling (optional)</li>
      <li>Sesame seeds, for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Brown the butter: In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, swirling occasionally, until the butter turns amber in color and smells nutty, about 5-7 minutes. Be careful not to burn it. Pour into a heat-proof bowl and let cool for 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled brown butter and tahini. Add both sugars and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. Do not overmix.</li>
      <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks.</li>
      <li>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight (this step is crucial for developing flavor and texture).</li>
      <li>When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Form the dough into balls about 2 tablespoons in size and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 3 inches between cookies as they will spread.</li>
      <li>If desired, sprinkle each cookie with a small amount of flaky sea salt and/or sesame seeds.</li>
      <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft.</li>
      <li>Allow to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The Science Behind Brown Butter</h2>
    <p>Browning butter is a simple technique that adds incredible depth of flavor to your cookies. When butter is heated, its milk solids toast and develop complex, nutty flavors through a process called the Maillard reaction—the same reaction that creates the delicious flavors in seared steak and toasted bread.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Tahini Works in Cookies</h2>
    <p>Tahini, a paste made from ground sesame seeds, adds a subtle nuttiness that complements the brown butter beautifully. It also contributes to the cookies' chewy texture and helps them stay moist longer. If you're used to baking with nut butters like peanut or almond, tahini functions similarly but with its own distinctive flavor profile.</p>
    
    <h2>Storage Tips</h2>
    <p>These cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. The unbaked cookie dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months. If frozen, you can bake the cookies directly from frozen—just add 1-2 minutes to the baking time.</p>
