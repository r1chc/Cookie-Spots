    <p>Inspired by traditional Mexican chocolate flavors, these cookies combine rich dark chocolate with warming spices and a hint of heat from cayenne pepper. The result is a complex, sophisticated cookie that balances sweetness with subtle spice for an unforgettable treat.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon ground chipotle pepper (optional, for smoky flavor)</li>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>8 ounces dark chocolate (70-85% cocoa), chopped into chunks</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and chipotle pepper (if using). Set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, cream together butter and both sugars until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla extract.</li>
      <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined.</li>
      <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks and almonds (if using).</li>
      <li>Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best flavor development.</li>
      <li>When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Form the dough into balls about 2 tablespoons in size and place on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.</li>
      <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft.</li>
      <li>Allow to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>The History of Mexican Chocolate</h2>
    <p>Chocolate has deep roots in Mexican culinary history, dating back to the ancient Mayans and Aztecs who first cultivated cacao and prepared it as a bitter, spiced drink. Traditional Mexican chocolate typically includes cinnamon and sometimes other spices like vanilla or chili peppers. The combination of chocolate and heat is authentic to this culinary tradition, where chocolate was valued not just for its flavor but also for its stimulating properties.</p>
    
    <p>These cookies pay homage to that rich history by incorporating the warming spices and subtle heat that makes Mexican chocolate so distinctive and complex.</p>
    
    <h2>Tips for Perfect Spicy Chocolate Cookies</h2>
    <p>The key to getting the spice level right in these cookies is to start conservatively. If you're unsure about how much heat you want, begin with just 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. You can always add more in future batches once you know your preference.</p>
    
    <p>For the best chocolate flavor, invest in high-quality dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa content. Chopping a chocolate bar yourself (rather than using pre-made chips) creates melty pockets of chocolate throughout the cookies and a more complex flavor.</p>
    
    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <p>These spicy chocolate cookies pair beautifully with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A glass of cold milk to temper the heat</li>
      <li>Coffee with a hint of cinnamon</li>
      <li>Mexican hot chocolate for a double dose of those warming flavors</li>
      <li>Vanilla ice cream for a hot-and-cold contrast</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store these cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. The flavor of the spices actually intensifies slightly after a day or two. The dough can also be frozen for up to 3 months—either freeze the prepared dough in a block, or pre-form cookie dough balls and freeze them individually for baking on demand.</p>
