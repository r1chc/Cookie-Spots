    <p>These no-bake chocolate peanut butter cookies are the perfect treat for when you're craving something sweet but don't want to turn on the oven. They come together in just minutes and require only a handful of pantry staples. The combination of chocolate and peanut butter creates an irresistible flavor that everyone will love!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup milk (whole or 2% works best)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
      <li>3 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup chopped peanuts (optional, for extra crunch)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a large saucepan, combine sugar, butter, milk, and cocoa powder.</li>
      <li>Bring the mixture to a rolling boil over medium heat, stirring constantly.</li>
      <li>Once boiling, continue to boil for exactly 1 minute (this is crucial for the cookies to set properly).</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and immediately stir in the vanilla extract and peanut butter until smooth.</li>
      <li>Add the oats and salt, stirring until completely coated.</li>
      <li>If using, fold in the chopped peanuts.</li>
      <li>Working quickly before the mixture begins to set, drop rounded tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
      <li>Let the cookies cool at room temperature until set, about 30-45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Tips for Perfect No-Bake Cookies</h2>
    <p>The key to successful no-bake cookies is timing. Be sure to boil the mixture for exactly 1 minute - no more, no less. Boiling too long will result in dry, crumbly cookies, while not boiling long enough will leave you with cookies that don't set properly.</p>
    
    <p>Weather can also affect your cookies. On humid days, they may take longer to set or remain slightly soft. If this happens, you can refrigerate them to help them firm up.</p>
    
    <h2>Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add 1/2 cup of shredded coconut for tropical flair</li>
      <li>Substitute almond butter for peanut butter if you prefer</li>
      <li>Add 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon for a warm spiced flavor</li>
      <li>Mix in 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips once the mixture has cooled slightly</li>
      <li>For a more festive cookie, add colorful sprinkles on top while they're still warm</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>Store these no-bake cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months - just thaw at room temperature before serving.</p>
